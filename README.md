# Student To Software Developer - Bridge Course

We all know Engineering students especially the ones studying in colleges located in non metros, has serious gap in preparing themselves for industry 

To address this gap, we are launching **Student to Software Developer** bridge course

### Why are we doing this

> Youth is the best time. The way in which you utilize this period will decide the nature of coming years that lie ahead of you
> 
>  -- Swami Vivekanandha 

In order to contribute to Nation Building, we believe it's best to invest our time with Youth of this nation. Hence we are starting this effort with the Student community

---

### Eligibility
BE/B.Tech students (CSE/IT/ECE) in their 2nd/3rd/4th year in academics, BCA 2nd/3rd year, MCA students

---

### Course Format
**Mode** - Live online training preferably in Zoom/Google Meet
**Total Duration** - 12 hours

Topics will be covered in multiple sessions. Each session may extend for an hour or two. To avoid conflict with our regular job schedule, we will try to keep the sessions mostly on Saturday & Sundays

---

### Course Fee
It's a **FREE** course

We are taking this course purely on a voluntary basis. If a student decides to pay voluntarily for our efforts, they can pay to selected NGOs fighting for good causes (will share the list of NGOs later). Again we, volunteers, won't have any monetary benefit out of this effort

### Faculty Details
Currently, myself (@IamVickyAV on Twitter) is the only faculty member. I will try to add my friends who are interested in this initiative in coming days

---

### Teaching Language
Tamil & English

---

### Schedule
The initial kick off session is planned by May 30, 2021. The session should tentatively complete before end of June

---

### Seats
In the past, we tried to accommodate as many students as we could for all of our sessions. Though we got the crowd, the results were not very welcoming. We felt our efforts went in vain. Hence we are planning to limit the number of seats to just 10 for each batch

Preference will be given for Students coming from colleges located in Non metro locations
