# Student To Software Developer - Bridge Course

We all know students especially the ones studying in colleges located in non metros, have serious gap in preparing themselves for industry 

To address this gap, we are launching **Student to Software Developer** bridge course

---

### Eligibility
BE/B.Tech students (CSE/IT/ECE) in their 2nd/3rd/4th year in academics, BCA 2nd/3rd year, MCA students

---

### Course Format
**Mode** - Live online training preferably in Zoom/Google Meet
**Total Duration** - 12 hours

Topics will be covered in multiple sessions. Each session may extend for an hour or two. To avoid conflicts with our regular job schedule, we will try to keep the sessions mostly on Saturday & Sundays

---

### Course Fee
It's a **FREE** course

We are taking this course purely on a voluntary basis. If a student decides to pay voluntarily for our efforts, they can pay to selected NGOs fighting for good causes (will share the list of NGOs later). Again we, volunteers, won't have any monetary benefit out of this effort

### Seats
In the past, we tried to accommodate as many students as we could for all of our sessions. Though we got the crowd, the results were not very welcoming. We felt our efforts went in vain. Hence we are planning to limit the number of seats to just **10** for each batch

Preference will be given to Students coming from colleges located in Non metro locations
